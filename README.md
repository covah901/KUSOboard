# KUSOboard
KUSOboard is a Longan Nano based keyboard using KarlK90's branch of QMK 
All info on Karl's branch and YAEMK can be found here: https://karlk90.github.io/yaemk-split-kb/

Regarding the naming of the files, I had started out meaning to make an Atreus size board, but decided against it shortly after starting the project. 
It was reduced to something more like a Reviung39.
